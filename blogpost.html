        <p>In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a
            letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication
            through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is an invention of
            language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to
            others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the
            audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken
            language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time.</p>
